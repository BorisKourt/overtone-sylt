* Overtone Sylt

Sylt is an environment for collaborative noise exploration using
Overtone.


** How does it work?

Overtone, jackd, and vlc are packaged inside a Docker container.

- Overtone manages most of the collaborative noise exploration part.
Overtone exposes a web-repl, and a nrepl.

- jackd is a dependency ov overtone, and is a sound server

- vlc is used to communicate with jackd from the outside
