* Overtone Sylt

Sylt is an environment for collaborative noise exploration using
Overtone.


** How does it work?

Overtone, jackd, and vlc are packaged inside a Docker container.

- Overtone manages most of the collaborative noise exploration part.
Overtone exposes a web-repl, and a nrepl.

- jackd is a dependency ov overtone, and is a sound server

- vlc is used to communicate with jackd from the outside

** Build and run
docker build -t sylt  . && docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 32768:32768 -p 9999:9999 -p 1234:1234/udp -it sylt 

So theres a bunch of ports. Many ports is much complexity, so the aim
is to reduce these via proxying if possible.

Listen to the noise with something like:
mplayer rtsp://localhost:9999/test.sdp


** The name
Sylt means Jam in Swedish. This joke is no worse than the Leiningen
joke. Well okay, it's worse.
